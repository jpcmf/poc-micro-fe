# POC Micro-Frontend

<p>In this repository you'll find a case study example of an app using the concepts of Module Federation with React and using react-router-dom to manage the routing.</p>

## :gear: Build Setup

You need run these commands in the directories in a different terminal window for each app:

```bash
yarn && yarn start
```

Tip: For the server you need run the app in develop mode:

yarn && yarn start:dev
```
